# v353 Enhancements
- Merged OpenAPI fragments into `openapi/openapi.json` (Progest-E endpoints included).
- Contract test utilities with AJV; example schema test for Progest-E summary.
- Wired circuit-breaker HTTP client (`requestWithCB`) across more outbound call sites (best-effort).
- PII scanner enhanced with DOB/address patterns and a directory scanner CLI.
- Docs for OpenAPI workflow.
