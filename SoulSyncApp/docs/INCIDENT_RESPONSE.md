# INCIDENT RESPONSE

## Severity Levels
- SEV1: Outage > 15 min or > 5% users affected
- SEV2: Degradation / high error rate
- SEV3: Minor incident

## First 15 minutes
1. Acknowledge alert.
2. Assign Incident Commander (IC).
3. Communicate status in #incidents channel (or equivalent).
4. Mitigation first (scale up, rollback, feature flag off).

## Post-incident
- Create a timeline and root cause analysis.
- Action items with owners + due dates.
- Add alert/rule to prevent recurrence.
